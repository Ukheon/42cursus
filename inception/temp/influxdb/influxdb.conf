###
### Controls where the actual shard data for InfluxDB lives and how it is
### flushed from the WAL. "dir" may need to be changed to a suitable place
### for your system, but the WAL settings are an advanced configuration. The
### defaults should work for most systems.

  # The amount of time that a write will wait before fsyncing.  A duration
  # greater than 0 can be used to batch up multiple fsync calls.  This is useful for slower
  # disks or when WAL write contention is seen.  A value of 0s fsyncs every write to the WAL.
  # Values in the range of 0-100ms are recommended for non-SSD disks.

### [shard-precreation]
###
### Controls the precreation of shards, so they are available before data arrives.
### Only shards that, after creation, will have both a start- and end-time in the

### or partially in the past.
